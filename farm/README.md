# NIGERIA FARMLAND PROJECT

This project embarks on an exploration of Nigeria farmland data, with a specific focus on crucial agricultural processes essential for food production sustainability. We aim to unravel the distribution of farm types, identify primary agricultural focuses, and evaluate the prevalence of processing facilities within these agricultural landscapes.
Through meticulous analysis and data-driven exploration, we endeavor to provide an overview of farmland data, facilitating informed decision-making, and fostering deeper insights into the intricacies of agricultural systems.
